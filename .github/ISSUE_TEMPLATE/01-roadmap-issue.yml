        ## Open edX Roadmap Issue Submission
        This template standardizes a method of representing all _**current, in-flight Initiatives and in-planning Initiatives**_ that will be contributed to the Open edX Platform. It is intended to provide a high-level overview of the scope of the work, the approach, the value-add, and the anticipated impact. It should be written in such a way that a newcomer who may be unfamiliar with the Open edX platform can quickly gain an understanding of the “what”, the “why” and the “how” of the Initiative. See https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3875962884/How+to+submit+an+open+source+contribution+for+Product+Review for more detail.
